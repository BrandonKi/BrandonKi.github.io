With the combination of 0% APR introductory periods and bonuses for spending small sums of money I saw a low effort opportunity for arbitrage.</p><p>It seems basically like free money right? So I decided to experiment a little and see if it's actually worth it.</p><p>Here are the terms for the card I was looking at:</p><ul><li><p>$25K limit</p></li><li><p>0% APR for 15 months</p></li><li><p>$200 after spending $1500</p></li><li><p>minimum payment: flat fee or 1% (will be 1% in this case)</p></li><li><p>5% cash back on top category each, only works on first $500 spent</p></li><li><p>1% cash back for all other purchases</p></li><li><p>no annual fee</p></li></ul><h2 class=blog-header>Picking An Investment</h2><p>First of all, the most important part, is to pick where to put this $25k. In other words how much risk am I willing to take on?</p><p>In this case, my appetite for risk is extremely low, especially since there are some perfectly good risk-free investment options available. I'll be going with <a class=link href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp>3 Month Treasury Bills</a>.<sup><a class=link href=#footnote1>1</a></sup><p>For the sake of making calcuations easy I'll be assuming a flat %5.1 over 15 months(April 2023 to July 2024). Realistically it's a bit higher but it doesn't matter much.</p><figure><img width=650px src=TBillRate.png><figcaption>3 Month T Bill Rate</figcaption></figure><p>Another option, assuming I was willing to take on some risk would have been to put the money in <a href=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOO/ class=link>VOO</a> instead which tracks the S&P 500. For the same time period above it would have returns about 33%. Remember though, this involves some added risk so it's not exactly "free money".</p><figure><img width=650px src=voo.png><figcaption>VOO</figcaption></figure><h2 class=blog-header>Arbitrage</h2><p>Ok, now that I've picked where I'll be putting the money, lets see how to maximize my returns.</p><p>The general strategy is to max out the card and instead of paying it off I would instead keep the money in 3 month treasuty bills. Also, ideally I would try to maximize rewards and cash back at the same time.</p><p>Step one is to max out the card. First of all, since I spent $1,500 I would get $200 right off the bat. Then from the cash back, I would get 5% back on $500 and %1 back on the remaining $24,500.<sup><a class=link href=#footnote2>2</a></sup></p><p>This comes out to a total of (0.05 * $500) + (0.01 * $24500) + $200 = $470.</p><p>Also, the interest from 15 months of 3 month treasury bills, assuming a flat 5.1%, would be the following: $25,000 * 0.051 * 15/12 = $1,593.75.</p><p>That's $1,593.75 + $470 = $2,063.75 in total! It's basically free as well.</p><h2 class=blog-header>Minimum Payments</h2><p>There is one thing I overlooked so far. Even though there's a 15 month 0% APR period, I still need to make the minimum payments. For this card the minimum is 1% per month or a flat fee, whichever is higher. In this case the 1% is definitely higher since we're keeping the card basically maxed out.</p><p>Over the course of the whole 15 months, with the help of the finite geometric series formula, I know I need to spend ($25,000*0.01)*((1-0.99^(15))/(1-0.99))=$3,498.75 on the monthly minimum payments.</p><p>To remedy this, I could buy 3 or 4 less treasury bills across the time period, and use my cash back rewards for some payments, or use other income to subsidize this. Assuming I didn't use other income I would profit somewhere around $200 less, but that's just a quick estimate. In this case I'll use other income though.</p><h2 class=blog-header>Conclusion</h2><p>I made a profit of $2,063.75, and basically didn't have to do anything. Risk free! <p>If I had a higher risk tolerance that could have been 25000 * 0.33 * 15/12 = $10,312.50.</p><h2 class=blog-header>Notes</h2><ol><li id=footnote1><p>Just for completeness, it's also possible to get better risk-free returns from CDs or even some HYSAs. I decided to stick with T Bills for this though.</p></li><li id=footnote2><p>You may be thinking that I can actually make a bit more money by simply delaying some of my purchases a single month in order to get 5% cash back. This is true, but the returns would be almost neglible because it would also delay my purchase for another treasury bill. In other words while I would earn more cash back I would also be losing out on interest at the same time.</div></div><div class="d-none d-md-block col-xl-2 col-lg-2 col-md-2 col-sm-0 col-0"><div class="row justify-content-end"><div class=col style="padding-right: 30px; border-right: thick solid yellow"><div class="row justify-content-end"><h3><a class=chill-link href=/home>Home</a></h2></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h3><a class=chill-link href=/portfolio>Portfolio</a></h2></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h3><a class=chill-link href=/blog>Blog</a></h2></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h3><a class=chill-link href=/resources>Resources</a></h2></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h3><a class=chill-link href=/contact>Contact</a></h2></div></div></div></div></div></div>
