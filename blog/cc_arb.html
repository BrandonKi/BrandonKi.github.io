So I decided to experiment a bit and see if it's actually worth it.<p>Here are the terms for the card I was looking at:<ul><li><p>$\$25$K limit<li><p>$0\%$ APR for 15 months<li><p>$\$200$ after spending $\$1500$<li><p>Minimum payment: flat fee or $1\%$, whichever is higher<li><p>$5\%$ cash back on top spending category, valid for the first $\$500$ spent<li><p>$1\%$ cash back for all other purchases<li><p>No annual fee</ul><h2 class=blog-header>Picking An Investment</h2><p>First of all, the most important part, is to pick where to put this $\$25$k. This basically comes down to the question, how much risk am I willing to take on?<p>In this case, my appetite for risk is extremely low, especially since there are some solid risk-free investment options available. I've decided to go with <a class=link href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp>3 Month Treasury Bills</a>.<sup><a class=link href=#footnote1 id=backref1>1</a></sup><p>To simplifiy calcuations, I'll be assuming a flat $5.1\%$ annual return over 15 months(April 2023 to July 2024). Realistically, it's slightly higher, but it won't signifcantly affect the outcome.<figure><img class=blog-image src=cc_arb_t_bill_rate.png><figcaption>3 Month T Bill Rate</figcaption></figure><p>Another option, assuming I was willing to take on some risk, would have been to put the money in <a class=link href=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOO/>VOO</a> instead, which tracks the S&P 500. Over the same 15-month period, VOO has seen returns of about $33\%$. Remember though, this involves some added risk, so it's not exactly "free money".<figure><img class=blog-image src=cc_arb_voo.png><figcaption>VOO</figcaption></figure><h2 class=blog-header>Arbitrage</h2><p>Ok, now that I've picked where I'll be putting the money, lets see how to maximize returns.<p>The general strategy is to max out the card and, instead of paying it off, I would instead keep the money in 3 month treasury bills. Also, ideally I would try to maximize rewards and cash back at the same time.<p>Step one is to max out the card. First of all, since I spent $\$1,500$ I would get $\$200$ right off the bat. Then from the cash back, I would get $5\%$ back on the first $\$500$ and $1\%$ back on the remaining $\$24,500$.<sup><a class=link href=#footnote2 id=backref2>2</a></sup><p>This comes out to a total of $(0.05 * \$500) + (0.01 * \$24500) + \$200 = \$470$.<p>Additionally, the interest from 15 months of 3 month treasury bills, assuming a flat $5.1\%$, is: $\$25,000 * 0.051 * \frac{15}{12} = \$1,593.75$.<p>That's $\$1,593.75 + \$470 = \$2,063.75$ in total! It's basically risk-free.<h2 class=blog-header>Minimum Payments</h2><p>There is one thing I overlooked so far. Even though there's a 15 month 0% APR period, I still need to make the minimum payments. For this card the minimum is 1% per month or a flat fee, whichever is higher. In this case the 1% is definitely higher since we're keeping the card basically maxed out.<p>Over the course of the whole 15 months, with the help of the finite geometric series formula, I would need to spend $$(\$25,000*0.01)*\frac{1-0.99^{15}}{(1-0.99)}=\$3,498.75$$ on the monthly minimum payments.<p>In this case, I'll use other income to cover the payments. However, I could also reduce the number of Treasury Bills I purchase by 3 or 4 over the period and apply my cash back rewards toward the payments. If I didn't use other income, my profit would be around $200 less.<h2 class=blog-header>Conclusion</h2><p>From this little experiment I would profit $\$2,063.75$, with minimal effort and no risk as well!<p>If I had a higher risk tolerance I could have invested in VOO instead, which could resulted in a profit of $\$25000 * 0.33 * \frac{15}{12} = \$10,312.50$.<p>However, this isn't risk-free, and the safer route still provides an easy profit.<p>Overall, this can be a way to generate some extra cash with minimal effort, but there are downsides. High credit utilization can negatively impact your credit score, and it also requires a significant amount of available capital upfront. Because of this, there are likely more practical investment options available.<h2 class=blog-header>Footnotes</h2><ol><li id=footnote1><p>Just for completeness, it's also possible to get better risk-free returns from CDs or even some HYSAs. I decided to stick with T Bills for this though. <a class=link href=#backref1 style=font-family:monospace>↩</a> <li id=footnote2><p>You may be thinking that I can actually make a bit more money by simply delaying some of my purchases a single month in order to get $5\%$ cash back. This is true, but the returns would be almost neglible because it would also delay my purchase for another treasury bill. In other words while I would earn more cash back I would also be losing out on interest at the same time. <a class=link href=#backref2 style=font-family:monospace>↩</a></ol></div></div></div><div class="d-none d-md-block col-xl-2 col-lg-2 col-md-2 col-sm-0 col-0"><div class="row justify-content-end"><div style="border-right:thick solid #ff0;padding-right:30px" class=col><div class="row justify-content-end"><h1 class="top-level-nav fs-4"><a class=chill-link href=/home>Home</a></h1></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h1 class="top-level-nav fs-4"><a class=chill-link href=/portfolio>Portfolio</a></h1></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h1 class="top-level-nav fs-4"><a class=chill-link href=/blog>Blog</a></h1></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h1 class="top-level-nav fs-4"><a class=chill-link href=/reading>Reading</a></h1></div><div class="row justify-content-end"><h1 class="top-level-nav fs-4"><a class=chill-link href=/contact>Contact</a></h1></div></div></div></div></div></div>
